# hello-world
My first github repository

Hi there!
My name Is Aiva
I'm completely new to programming and I just started learning,
I am currently teaching myself python using "learn python the hard way"
It's pretty fun, though confusing at times,
I will get the hang of it eventually,
I just have to keep working hard
